# SCT_DS_4 – Traffic Accident Data Analysis

This project is part of the **SkillCraft Technology – Data Science Internship (Task 04)**.

## Objective
The objective of this task is to analyze traffic accident data and identify meaningful patterns related to:
- Time of day
- Day of week
- Weather conditions
- Visibility and temperature
- Geographic accident hotspots

The goal is to understand contributing factors behind road accidents using exploratory data analysis and visualizations.

## Analysis & Visualizations Performed

### Time-Based Analysis
- Accident distribution by **hour of day**
- Accident distribution by **day of week**
- Identification of peak accident hours (rush hours)

### Weather & Environmental Factors
- Most common weather conditions during accidents
- Relationship between **weather condition and accident severity**
- Impact of **visibility** on accident occurrences
- Temperature distribution across accident severity levels

### Geographic Analysis
- Top states with the highest number of accidents
- Heatmap visualization of accident **hotspots across the United States**

---

## Key Insights
- Accidents are more frequent during morning and evening rush hours
- Certain weather conditions contribute to higher accident frequency
- Reduced visibility is a significant contributing factor
- Specific regions show consistently higher accident densities
- Severity varies with environmental and weather conditions

---

## Outcome
This project demonstrates how exploratory data analysis and visualization can be used to:
- Identify accident-prone time periods
- Understand environmental risk factors
- Visualize geographic hotspots
- Support data-driven insights for traffic safety analysis

---

## Internship Task Completion
✔ Time-based analysis  
✔ Weather and environmental factor analysis  
✔ Multiple meaningful visualizations  
✔ Geographic hotspot visualization  
✔ Clean project structure and documentation  

This project successfully fulfills **Task 04** of the SkillCraft Data Science Internship.
